        <div class="content has-text-justified">
Text-to-Music (T2M) diffusion models increasingly adopt Transformer backbones (DiT), 
yet practical deployments often rely on short tag-style prompts and face persistent challenges: generations can collapse to limited patterns, while controlling diversity at inference time remains difficult under strict semantic requirements. Training-free sampling methods like CADS, while effective in Text-to-Image, can severely degrade alignment and fidelity in TTM because early-timestep perturbations strongly alter global musical attributes (e.g., genre, mood, structure). We propose two complementary solutions: Padding Annealed Diffusion Sampling (PADS), which injects timestep-dependent noise only into padding tokens while freezing semantic tokens to prevent semantic drift, and Text-Aligned Latent (TAL), a text-aware latent space learned via a redesigned VAE so diffusion sampling occurs near text-consistent neighborhoods. Together, PADS+TAL improve diversity while preserving prompt-aligned global attributes in TTM.

## Table: Comparison of Computable and Non-Computable Numbers

| Computable Numbers | Non-Computable Numbers |
|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Rational numbers, e.g., 1/2, 3/4 | Transcendental numbers, e.g., π, e |
| Algebraic numbers, e.g., √2, ∛3 | Non-algebraic numbers, e.g., √2 + √3 |
| Numbers with finite decimal representations | Numbers with infinite, non-repeating decimal representations |

He used the concept of a universal Turing machine to prove that the set of computable functions is recursively enumerable, meaning it can be listed by an algorithm.

## Significance
Turing's paper laid the foundation for the theory of computation and had a profound impact on the development of computer science. The Turing machine became a fundamental concept in theoretical computer science, serving as a theoretical model for studying the limits and capabilities of computation. Turing's work also influenced the development of programming languages, algorithms, and the design of modern computers.
